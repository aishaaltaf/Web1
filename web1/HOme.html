    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. </br>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</br>
         when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make</br>
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap</br>
         into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised</br>
          in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,</br>
           and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including</br>
            versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
